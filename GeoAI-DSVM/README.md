### Overview

A geo-spatial analytics and AI extension to the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine
The Geo AI Data Science VM is an extension to the Windows Server 2016 edition of the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) on Azure, offered through the collaboration between Esri and Microsoft. The Microsoft DSVM contains popular tools for data science as well as AI tools, such as enterprise grade R and Python on the Microsoft Machine Learning Server, Anaconda Python, JuliaPro, Jupyter Notebook for Python, Julia and R, Visual Studio Community edition with Python and R Tools, SQL Server Developer edition, standalone instance of Apache Spark, deep-learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, and several other data science tools and machine learning algorithms. See a comprehensive list of Microsoft DSVM tools and algorithms.

ArcGIS Pro is Esri’s next-gen 64-bit desktop geographic information system (GIS). Technologically ahead of everything else on the market, ArcGIS Pro provides professional 2D and 3D mapping in an intuitive user interface. ArcGIS Pro is a big step forward in advancing visualization, analytics, image processing, data management, and integration.

The Geo AI Data Science VM augments the Microsoft DSVM with rich geo-spatial capabilities of Esri’s ArcGIS Pro. Python and R interfaces to ArcGIS Pro are pre-configured on the Geo AI Data Science VM, enabling programmatic access to geo-spatial analytics within your AI applications out of the box. We also provide samples in the form of Jupyter notebooks to help you start building AI applications infused with geo-spatial intelligence.

If you are building deep learning models on the Geo AI Data Science VM, we recommend you use Azure NC-Series GPU VM instances which is available in select Azure regions. Check here for availability of various services by Azure regions.

By continuing to create and use this extension, you are accepting the Esri ArcGIS Pro license agreements and the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine terms.
