Please refer to this [repository](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-interactive-voice-response-bot) which contains instructions and the necessary code to deploy an Interactive Voice Response Bot.

Customer interaction is essential to a business of any size, and response-automation is a key component to scaling up communication volume. In fact, [61%][3] of consumers prefer to communicate via speech, and most of them prefer self-service. Because customer satisfaction is a priority for all businesses, self-service is a critical facet of any customer-facing communications strategy.

This solution creates an intelligent interactive voice response (IVR) application that processes customer order requests for bicycles and bicycle accessories.
Businesses with no existing IVR solution can easily get started automating requests, or where existing human-operated systems exist, this solution can be extended to incorporate existing functionality and workflows.

Today, mobile phones are dominant, but keypads are not always readily accessible. This solution provides an intuitive, simple, and convenient way for callers to convey their requests and receive immediate responses. The outcome is an intelligent and natural self-service experience that can be repurposed across other customer-facing channels.

This solution package contains materials to help both technical and business audiences understand the solution, which is built on [Azure][7] and [Microsoft Cognitive Services][2].
