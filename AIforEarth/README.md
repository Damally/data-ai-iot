# Pixel-level land cover classification

Please check out the GitHub Repository [pixel_level_land_classification](https://github.com/Azure/pixel_level_land_classification) for all of the samples.

This repository contains a tutorial illustrating how to create a deep neural network model that accepts an aerial image as input and returns a land cover label (forested, water, etc.) for every pixel in the image. Microsoft's [Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/) is used to train and evaluate the model on an [Azure Geo AI Data Science Virtual Machine](http://aka.ms/dsvm/GeoAI) or an [Azure Batch AI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch-ai/) GPU cluster. The method shown here was developed in collaboration between the [Chesapeake Conservancy](http://chesapeakeconservancy.org/), [ESRI](https://www.esri.com), and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/research/) as part of Microsoft's [AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/aiforearth) initiative.
