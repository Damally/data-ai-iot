# How to Develop a Currency Detection Model using Azure Machine Learning

## Introduction
"How do we teach a machine to see?"

Seeing AI is an exciting research project that harnesses the power of Artificial Intelligence to open the visual world and describe nearby people, text, currency, color and objects with spoken audio. It is designed for the blind and low vision community, to understand more about who and what is around them. Today, the iOS smartphone app has empowered users to complete over 5 million tasks unassisted, including many "first time in life" experiences for the blind community, like take and posting photos of friends on Facebook, recognizing products independently at a store, reading kids homework and more. To learn more visit [Seeing.AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/seeing-ai/).

One of the most common needs among the blind community is to recognize paper currency. Currency notes are usually inaccessible, as they are hard to recognize purely through tactical feeling. To solve this scenario, the Seeing AI team built a real time currency recognizer which can instantly speak the denomination in view, with high precision (in under 25 milliseconds). Since the target user often does not have perception of whether the currency note is in the camera view or not, having a real time spoken experience acts as a feedback to help user frame it until it's clearly visible as well as not too close or too dark.
