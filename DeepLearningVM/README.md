### Overview

A pre-configured environment for deep learning using GPU instances
The Deep Learning Virtual Machine (DLVM) is a specially configured variant of the Data Science Virtual Machine(DSVM) to make it easier to use GPU-based VM instances for training deep learning models. It is supported on Windows 2016, or the Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine and shares the same core VM images (and hence all the rich toolset) as the DSVM. We also provide end-to-end AI samples for image and text understanding. The deep learning virtual machine also makes the rich set of tools and samples on the DSVM more easily discoverable. In terms of the tooling, the Deep Learning Virtual Machine provides several popular deep learning frameworks, tools to acquire and pre-process image, textual data.

The DLVM contains several tools for AI including popular GPU editions of deep learning frameworks like Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, TensorFlow, Keras, Caffe2, Chainer; tools to acquire and pre-process image, textual data, tools for data science modeling and development activities such as Microsoft R Server Developer Edition, Anaconda Python, Jupyter notebooks for Python and R, IDEs for Python and R , SQL database and many other data science and ML tools.

The DLVM runs on Azure GPU NC-series VM instances. These GPUs use discrete device assignment, resulting in performance close to bare-metal, and are well-suited to deep learning problems..
