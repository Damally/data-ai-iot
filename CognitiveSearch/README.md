## Cognitive Search Pattern
This project demonstrates the Cognitive Search pattern in Azure using the JFK files.

This pattern feeds data into the cloud, applies a set of cognitive skills
 which extracts knowledge and stores it as annotations
 and creates new experiences exploring the data using Search.
